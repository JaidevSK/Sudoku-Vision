# 1. Aim
- To develop an application that solves Sudoku puzzles from images using the most optimal method for different difficulty levels (by adjusting the proportion of the problem that will be solved by Constraint satisfaction and Backtracking).
- To explore the usage of Reinforcement Learning in solving Sudoku puzzles

# 2. Methodology
## 2.1 Sudoku Vision Application
### 2.1.1 Digit Optical Character Recognition
Since we aim to solve sudokus directly from the images (without requiring the user to manually type the sudoku digits), one of the most important tasks is to have a computer vision model for the classification of the given images of individual digits into their respective classes of digits. This is the task of Optical Character Recognition or OCR. In order to perform the task of OCR, we can either use the python library of EasyOCR or develop a model from scratch. We have taken the second approach. The dataset for the
